# Remere's Map Editor: Redux

**This is WIP. No stable release yet.**

Hi everyone,

Building a Tibia map editor from scratch gave me a massive boost in knowledge regarding tile-based system optimization and using agentic workflows to upgrade legacy code in a slow, precise, and verifiable manner.

I decided to apply this knowledge to the "gold standard" of the OT community - Remere's Map Editor (RME) - using a modern approach. I am proud to announce **RME: Redux**, a project aimed at rewriting the RME backend with modern technologies.

After ~900 commits, here is a brief summary of what has been achieved:

- Decoupled the monolithic codebase into smaller, single-responsibility modules for better maintainability.
- Organized the code into a cleaner, more logical folder hierarchy.
- Upgraded OpenGL from 1.x to 4.x and WxWidgets from 2.9.x to 3.3.x.
- Introduced new rendering for GUI and overlay passes using NanoVG.
- Completely rewrote the map renderer to support async sprite loading, sprite batching, ring buffers, and more. You can now run RME at 160+ FPS.
- Rewrote the light renderer into a pure GPU-based system.

**New Features:**
- New tooltip system (NanoVG).
- In-game preview with player walking simulation.
- Autoborder preview.
- New tile replacement with a custom similarity-finder algorithm.
- Shader system (Anti-aliasing, Retro-CRT, 4xBRZ).
- SVG support.
- and more :)

- Refactored a significant portion of the code into C++20.
- Removed extensive dead code, raw pointers, "hacks," and poor memory management. I’ve fixed more bugs than I can count.
- Numerous Quality-of-Life changes to both the code and the UI.

**Note:** Since I’ve changed so much at once, I have inevitably introduced some new bugs! :)

## Known Issues

- Zone brushes are currently non-functional.
- Tool options buttons (changing doors, arches, etc.) are not working.
- Changing clients/map versions requires an app restart.
- The fog system and minimap export are currently disabled.
- There are likely more bugs I haven't caught yet

## The Roadmap

- Unified properties and browser field window.
- Tileset Overhaul: No more hardcoded tilesets.
- Integrated Palette/Tileset/Brush/Border editor with a WYSIWYG right-click interface.
- Enhanced autoborder with custom rules.
- Native Tibia assets/Protobuf loading.
- CipSoft format support (items.srv, map.sec, etc.).

## Why did I start this?

As a casual map maker, many things bothered me about the original RME for years. AI technology finally allowed me to implement the changes I wanted to see. Building a map editor with ImGui (which is not abandoned) taught me a lot, and I wanted to bring that level of modernization to RME.

The project is **100% open-source** and available here:

**GitHub:** https://github.com/karolak6612/remeres-map-editor-redux

Latest compiled binary is here:

**Release Performance Test 0.0.1d** → https://github.com/karolak6612/remeres-map-editor-redux/releases/tag/Test

Keep in mind - this is not release build. Its buggy.

## Disclaimers

- This project is largely "vibe-coded." About 90% of the code was generated by various coding agents following SOLID principles.
- This project does not aim for 1:1 RME compatibility. Some features are completely reinvented and may introduce breaking changes. However, loading and editing OTBM maps should work in both the original RME and this version.
- **Bug Reports:** Please use the GitHub Issues page for bug reports.

## Support the Project

I develop this project for free as a hobby in my spare time. Many people on the OTA Discord have asked how they can support the project, and now you can.

The terms are simple:

- If you need a specific feature, consider a donation. We can discuss if it’s feasible and fits the project’s vision. I do not make private edits. I am firmly against gatekeeping; all funded features will be merged into the public repo for everyone.
- All donations go toward funding AI licenses (Cursor, Claude Code, Google Pro/Ultra) to keep this hobby free.
